Currently, SFT Protocol is seeking the first round of security audits and has launched a bug bounty program to enhance the security of SFT Protocol contracts and protect user funds.

The latest audit progress and results will be synchronized to the [**official website**](https://www.sftproject.io/), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/SFTProtocol), and other social media.

## 💵 Establishment of Reserve Fund

The creation of the Reserve Fund is aimed at addressing potential funding risks and providing emergency liquidity for the pool. Anyone can provide funding support for the Reserve Fund, and the SFT Protocol DAO manages the Reserve Fund account.

> Roles of the Reserve Fund: Reserve funds are used to cope with unpredictable events or exhaustion of pool liquidity. This helps ensure the controllability of the overall risk of the liquidity staking pool and reduces the risks faced by investors.

#### Priority bearing of asset losses:

When holders of rSFT in the pool face asset losses, the Reserve Fund can bear these losses first to avoid runs and unstable interest rates.

#### Enhancing investor confidence:

By setting up a Reserve Fund account, SFT Protocol can provide investors with a safer and more reliable investment environment, enhancing their confidence.
