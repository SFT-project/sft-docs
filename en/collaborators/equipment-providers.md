# ðŸ›¡ Equipment Providers

{% hint style="info" %}
Equipment providers are partners who provide equipment or data centers and do not need to understand mining technology or maintain equipment. SFT Protocol will help partners manage equipment, provide high-quality technical services, help them build and participate in DePIN, and share profits according to the contract.

The SFT protocol expects to build a large-scale, permissionless, trustless, and programmable physical infrastructure and hardware network using the SFT protocol token SPD.

Through the SFT encrypted economic protocol, SPD can incentivize supply-side participation in network construction and provide end-users with more cost-effective and innovative services than traditional models.

In the future, more equipment and data center providers are expected to join to expand the scale, and equipment providers do not need to understand Filecoin technology, as we have a very mature service team.
