# ü§ù FIL Holders

### 1. Staking FIL to the Sealing Nodes to earn high yields

Users can stake FIL to the Sealing Nodes on BSC and Filecoin's FVM through the Mint page. The on-chain contract will mint the same amount of SFT (during the activity period) and participate in the joint mining of the nodes. FIL holders and equipment providers share the mining revenue 5:5.
