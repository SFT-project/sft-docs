# ðŸ”Š Marketing Promotion Plan

What is rSPD?

SPD (SFT Protocol DAO) is the governance token of the SFT Protocol. It has protocol governance, voting, DeFi protocol ecology, service payment, mainstream public chain token for device mining, and can also be used for RPC cloud advanced version payment, hardware device ecological calling, AI data storage, privacy computation, etc.

As the project is in its early stages, we define rSPD as the future score of SPD, which can be exchanged at a 1:1 ratio. In order to ensure the long-term development of the SFT protocol, we will reward those who contribute to the project with rSPD.
