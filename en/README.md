## **1. LSD**

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms. However, holders staking tokens also incur a certain cost as they have to lock up their assets for a period of time, which may lead to missed profit opportunities. SFT Protocol provides liquidity staking through tokenization. Initially applied to Filecoin, it solves the problem of low liquidity during long-term staking periods. The protocol will also be applied to other public chains such as Ethereum.

## 2. Web3

SFT Protocol extends hardware to converge Web3 and Metaverse blockchain APIs. It provides storage solutions, privacy computing, DC datasets, RPC services, global distribution, automatic scaling, multi-cloud aggregation, and high-performance GPU computing to support a more secure and efficient Web3 infrastructure.

## 3. Artificial Intelligence

#### ① Facilitating data sharing and collaboration:

We provide support for decentralized data sharing and collaboration to promote the development of artificial intelligence and insight exchange.

#### ② Encouraging AI adoption in DeFi:

With the expansion of AI tools and services, we improve the user experience, trading strategies, and risk management by integrating AI tools and services.

#### ③ Providing decentralized storage solutions:

By integrating with the Filecoin storage network, we provide secure, reliable, and efficient decentralized storage solutions for AI.

In addition to empowering AI, SFT Protocol will continue to serve Web3 and be deployed on new public chains that emerge in the future.

**Currently, SFT Protocol has been deployed on BSC and Filecoin, and application chain services will be launched subsequently.**
